# ðŸ’§ Water Boiling Simulator
Source code for Water Boiling Simulator (Jamulator 2021 submission)

## What is this?
This is an old project I made years ago as a submission for the Jamulator 2021 game jam hosted on itch.io. It's my first public game!

## Why is the code so weird?
I'm not going to lie, I barely knew what I was doing at the time, BUT! In my defense, Water Boiling Simulator was made using **PICO-8**, which is, as the creators put it: A fantasy console meant to replicate the hardware limitations ***found in gaming systems from the 80s***.
Not only was this my first time using PICO-8, but it was also my first game jam ever.
<br>
<br>
It's also written in Lua.

### PICO-8 is so cool that I can export the entire game as a ***PNG***. The game is literally contained in this picture!

## What is the game about?
Boiling water.

## Boiling... Water...? Seriously?
Yep. The theme of the jam was, as the name implied, "Simulators". So uh, who doesn't like boiling water, am I right?

## There _**HAS**_ to be more to this, *right*?
You can play the game right here on itch.io: https://mrwolfyer.itch.io/water-boiling-simulator

Have fun!
